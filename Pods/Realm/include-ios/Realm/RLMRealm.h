/**
 An RLMRealm instance (also referred to as "a realm") represents a Realm
 database.

 Realms can either be stored on disk (see +[RLMRealm realmWithPath:]) or in
 memory (see +[RLMRealm inMemoryRealmWithIdentifier:]).

 RLMRealm instances are cached internally, and constructing equivalent RLMRealm
 objects (with the same path or identifier) multiple times on a single thread
 within a single iteration of the run loop will normally return the same
 RLMRealm object. If you specifically want to ensure a RLMRealm object is
 destroyed (for example, if you wish to open a realm, check some property, and
 then possibly delete the realm file and re-open it), place the code which uses
 the realm within an `@autoreleasepool {}` and ensure you have no other
 strong references to it.

 @warning RLMRealm instances are not thread safe and can not be shared across
 threads or dispatch queues. You must call this method on each thread you want
 to interact with the realm on. For dispatch queues, this means that you must
 call it in each block which is dispatched, as a queue is not guaranteed to run
 on a consistent thread.
