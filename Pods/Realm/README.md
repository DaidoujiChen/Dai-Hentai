Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.
This repository holds the source code for the iOS & OSX versions of Realm, for both Swift & Objective-C.


## Features

* **Mobile-first:** Realm is the first database built from the ground up to run directly inside phones, tablets and wearables.
* **Simple:** Data is directly [exposed as objects](http://realm.io/docs/cocoa/#models) and [queryable by code](http://realm.io/docs/cocoa/#queries), removing the need for ORM's riddled with performance & maintenance issues. Plus, we've worked hard to [keep our API down to just 4 common classes](http://realm.io/docs/cocoa/api/) (Object, Array, Results and Realms) and 1 utility class (Migrations): most of our users pick it up intuitively, getting simple apps up & running in minutes.
* **Modern:** Realm supports relationships, generics, vectorization and even Swift.
* **Fast:** Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations, while maintaining an extremely rich feature set.

## Setting up Realm in your app

Please see the [detailed instructions in our docs](http://realm.io/docs/cocoa/#installation) to install Realm in your Xcode project.

Once your app is set up with Realm, our [documentation](#documentation) will guide you to unleash its full potential.

## Documentation

Documentation for Realm can be found at [realm.io/docs/cocoa](http://realm.io/docs/cocoa). The API reference is located at [realm.io/docs/cocoa/api](http://realm.io/docs/cocoa/api).

## Building Realm

In case you don't want to use the precompiled version, you can build Realm yourself.

Prerequisites:

* Building Realm requires Xcode 6.
* Building Realm documentation requires [appledoc](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc)

Once you have all the necessary prerequisites, building Realm.framework just takes a single command: `sh build.sh build`. You'll need an internet connection the first time you build Realm to download the core binary.

Run `sh build.sh help` to see all the actions you can perform (build ios/osx, generate docs, test, etc.).

Executing the examples under the `examples/` folder, requires that you have built the `Realm.framework`.
